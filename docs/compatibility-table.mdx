# Compatibility table

The following table describes which versions of `patrol`
and `patrol_cli` are compatible with each other.
The simplest way to ensure that both packages are compatible
is by always using the latest version. However,
if for some reason that isn't possible, you can refer to 
the table below to assess which version you should use.

| patrol_cli            | patrol            | Flutter Version |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 3.2.0+                | 3.11.0+           | 3.16+           |
| 3.1.0 - 3.1.1         | 3.10.0            | 3.10 – 3.15     |
| 2.6.5 - 3.0.1         | 3.6.0 - 3.10.0    | 3.0 – 3.9       |
| 2.6.0 - 2.6.4         | 3.4.0 - 3.5.2     | 2.10 – 2.17     |
| 2.3.0 - 2.5.0         | 3.0.0 - 3.3.0     | 2.5 – 2.9       |
| 2.2.0 - 2.2.2         | 2.3.0 - 2.3.2     | 2.0 – 2.4       |
| 2.0.1 - 2.1.5         | 2.0.1 - 2.2.5     | 2.0 – 2.2       |
| 2.0.0                 | 2.0.0             | 2.0             |
| 1.1.4 - 1.1.11        | 1.0.9 - 1.1.11    | 1.x             |

->Why Flutter 3.16+? : `Patrol v3` requires `Flutter 3.16` or newer due to changes in the flutter_test package, impacting its compatibility​

->Backwards Compatibility : Older `Patrol versions` are mapped against Flutter versions to ensure users can easily pick compatible versions.
